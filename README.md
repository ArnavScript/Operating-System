# 🖥️ Operating System Notes & Practice (Love Babbar Playlist + GFG)

This repository is my personal collection of notes, key concepts, and important questions I practiced while learning **Operating Systems** from the [Love Babbar OS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA) and GeeksforGeeks.  
I’m not focusing on coding implementations here, but rather on understanding theory and solving MCQs, aptitude, and conceptual questions from GFG.
